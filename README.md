## This project uses a dummy api from [website](https://dummyapi.io/docs).

I created a free account on that website, then by using my app-id, I fetch data from there and by using these data, I prepared this mockup website.

You can view users, a single user in detail, posts, posts of a specific user, comments to a specific post, tag list and post by a specific tag in this website.

In App.js file, you can change userId, postId and tagWord values to get different data.

Also, in App.js file, you need to enter your own app-id to the 7 necessary fields, they are indicated by comments.

Then, just write npm start to terminal and program will work.
